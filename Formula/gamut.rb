# The Homebrew formula: what `brew install` builds gamut on a Mac from.
#
# It names the same released tarball as the PKGBUILD, so the two carry the
# same checksum; `bin/release` sets the version in both and
# `bin/pkgbuild-sha` the checksum, and then copies this file into the tap,
# dcervelli/homebrew-gamut, which is what Homebrew reads. Edit it here.
